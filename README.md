# MyReads - Udacity's React Fundamentals course final assessment project. 

This is a bookshelf App that allows you to classify a collection of books. You can place each book on three different shelves: currently-reading, want to read, and read. If you would like to change the shelf the book is on, click on the control button of that particular book and select the shelf you want it to be on.

You can also add more books to your library. To do so, click the button on the bottom left with a plus sign on it and search for keywords to find books by title or author's name. If you find any that interests you, you can move it to whichever shelf you desire.
